Comments:,"Study Data: The 2001 Commissioners Standard Ordinary (CSO) tables are based on Society of Actuaries’ (SOA) industry mortality experience collected over the years 1990-1995 for companies that participated in the study. Additional data from other sources was used to supplement the data at young and old ages where the experience data was sparse. The mortality was projected to the year 2001 using recent mortality improvement trends. Methodology: The 2001 CSO tables are built from the 2001Valaution Basic Tables (VBT) by adding a loading (See SOA Table Identities 1148-1153). The loading was designed as a margin to provide for variation in mortality risk both over time and among companies as well as unknown variation that could occur that include one-time events, such as a flu epidemic, as well as changes in overall mortality levels that might occur due to things like AIDS or changes in general health conditions. The Academy Task Force developed a loading formula that increases in dollars per $1,000 as the underlying mortality rate increases, but decreases when expressed as a percent as the underlying mortality rate increases. The formula has margins that increase in absolute terms, but decrease in percentage terms, as age increases. The margins also increase in absolute terms as the expectation of life decreases.
