Comments:,"Study Data: Canada’s Committee on Expected Experience, Individual Life (CEEIL) was concerned that at the time of the previous generation of tables (See SOA Table Identities 416-425) that the smoker and nonsmoker data available did not contain a sufficient number of deaths to give a reliable measure of mortality. Thus a margin was added to the smoker and nonsmoker tables in view of uncertainty of the correct values. Four more years of data has increased greatly the volume of deaths reported on a smoker and nonsmoker basis. Methodology: Ultimate rates for ages 0-15 based on both the select period and ultimate period data with the data combined by attained age. Ages 0-99 where then graduated with Whittaker B formula. Ages above 40 further smoothed by Makeham's Second Law using colog(p(x)) rather than mu(x). Ages 100-105 were appended by fitting a cubic so as to reach 1 at age 105. Age 0 was subsequently reset to the raw qx.  Select rates initially calculated as ratios to the ultimate expected in quinquennial issue age groups. These ratios where then graduated. Duration 1 selection factors were fitted to logistic-linear curve. The rate of decay of selection was based on a single power function for all attained ages. Together, a complete table of selection factors were obtained that could then be multiplied by the ultimate qx's for the same attained ages. Small final adjustments were made to bring actual-to-expected ratios to 100%. NOTE: A prior generation of this table had an unauthorized extension for select issue ages 81 to 90. As the rates were not produced or published by the CIA, they have been removed. Data Transcription Errors Detected: 07/2013. Data Corrected and Certified: 07/2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
