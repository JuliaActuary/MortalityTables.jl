Comments:,"Study Data: The 2001 Valuation Basic Tables (VBT) are based on the 1990-1995 Basic Tables that were developed by the Society of Actuaries’ (SOA) Individual Experience Studies Committee. The 1990-1995 Basic Tables are based on the mortality experience collected annually by the SOA over the years 1990-1995 for companies that participated in the study. Additional data from other sources was used to supplement the 1990-1995 Basic Tables at young and old ages where the experience data was sparse. The mortality was projected to the year 2001 using recent mortality improvement trends. Methodology:  The approach utilized in creating the 2001 age last birthday (ALB) tables, is the same as that used to create the 1980 CSO ALB tables as detailed in Transactions of the Society of Actuaries, Vol XXXIII (p. 671-672). During the select period, the lx’s utilized were those derived from adjacent issue ages. Data Transcription Errors: None:  Data Certified: 02/2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
