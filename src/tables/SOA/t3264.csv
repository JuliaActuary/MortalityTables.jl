Comments:,"Study Data: The 2015 VBT was developed based on the mortality experience from the SOA Individual Life Experience Committee studies from the 2002-2009 study period. Additional data from other sources was used to supplement the 2002-2009 experience at younger and older ages where industry experience was sparse. To develop the 2015 VBT table, the mortality was projected from March 1st, 2006 to July 1st, 2015, using recent mortality improvement trends. Data Certified: 07/2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
