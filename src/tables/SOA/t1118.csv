Comments:,"Study Data: A preferred version of the 2001 Valuation Basic Table (VBT) table (See SOA Table Identities 1148-1153) was not initially constructed as data on preferred risk mortality was considered inadequate at the time. In 2005, the American Council of Life Insurers engaged Tillinghast to develop a version of the 2001 Commissioners Standard Ordinary (CSO) for preferred risks. Tillinghast relied on the initial 1990-95 SOA experience data underlying the 2001 CSO tables (See SOA Table Identities 1136-1141) and 2001 VBT. They then supplemented the information with data from the SOA’s 1996-2001 individual life mortality experience study, the 1994 and 2005 SOA Preferred Risk Underwriting surveys, Tillinghast’s Old Age Mortality Study (TOAMS), Steve Cox’s 2004 article “Does Preferred Wear Off”, and various medical studies for specific health impairments. Methodology: Both the 2001 CSO and 2001 VBT non-smoker mortality tables were split into super-preferred, preferred, and residual standard. The respective CSO and VBT smoker tables were split into preferred and residual standard. Ratios of preferred risk to aggregate risk, as well as the principle of conservation of deaths, were used to accomplish the splits. Estimates were derived for the level of preferred risk early duration mortality and the persistence of preferred risk mortality differentials. The effects of underwriting selection were incorporated by looking at specific health impairments, namely: alcoholism, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and diabetes. The same loading formula for developing the 2001 CSO from the 2001 VBT was used to construct the preferred risk tables. Data Transcription Errors: None.
